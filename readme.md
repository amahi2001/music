# My First Django Project

This is my first ever django project which I created in 8/2021 when i first got my internship at NYPL in order to learn the basics of the framework. I'm not sure why I didn't version control this project but I'm glad I have it now as I reference it often.

## description
This project is a simple front-end website that allows a user to create albums and artists by using SQLlite3 as the database. I make use of the Django ORM to create model based CRUD operations and utilize Django ModelForms to create forms for the user to interact with low-code.
